##1st version without itertools
for x, a in enumerate(main_courses):

                print(a, b, c, price_main_courses[x] + price_desserts[y] + price_drinks[z])

##2nd version with itertools
for dishes, prices in zip(itertools.product(main_courses, desserts, drinks),
                          itertools.product(price_main_courses, price_desserts, price_drinks)):
    if sum(prices) <= 30:
        print(" ".join(dishes), sum(prices))
